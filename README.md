#### What is the problem we are solving?

The biggest hurdle for instructors using digital video conferencing platforms is giving social networking feel to their students. Let's imaging a system which can do following things.

- Imagine an instructor who wants to divide the class into groups on the fly, assign them group tasks and should be able to interact with the groups while groups are interacting among them.

- Imagine you are a student, how bad it feels because you can't talk(literally) to fellow students without actually disturbing the class. 

- Me as a student, I can take digital notes while attending the class on the same system that I am Using to attend the class.

#### Customers
- Teachers, Universities, Coaches
